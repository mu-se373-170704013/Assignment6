# Assignment6
I used NodeJS and MongoDB for server-side. <br/>
Server.js file is the main file. <br/>
Files in the models folder are my models for MongoDB, I saved in that form in database, <br/>
Files in the controllers folder are my controller where I do the operations in database, <br/>
Server is working at https://localhost:3000 <br/>

# To Run Server <br/>
-Firstly download node <br/>
-npm install <br/>
-npm run dev <br/>
